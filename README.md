# Fourier-Series-Interactive-Plotter-
Produced in matplotlib.pyplot, using the slider and Textbox packages this programme aims to run an interactive interface in which a user can input their a_0, a_n and b_n coefficients, then alter the number of iterations and visualise the function that they have produced.
